# PyBit
This is my attempt to create a crypto trading bot for python.
Inspired by CryptoGnome's ByBit Lickhunter, trading strategy will be based on bybit liquidation data, RSI and MACD.

pybit-Bot.py
This file uses the pybit python module to fetch liquidation data. You have to upgrade at least to python 3.9 !
